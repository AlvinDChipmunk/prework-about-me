        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Hi there! My name really is Alvin and some know me as the "Alvin Guy" from Comic Con. If you did a Google image search for "Alvin Comic Con", you'd find <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=alvin+comic+con&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS854US854&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjG8JXd4pLkAhWFtp4KHXJZCwgQ_AUIEygD&biw=1280&bih=610">me</a>!

            <h1>Where am I from?</h1>
            <p>I was born in Manila, Philippines, but since Dad was in the US Navy, we grew up in whatever Navy town that Dad got stationed in. That's how we eventually wound up here in San Diego, where he retired.</p>

            <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
            <p>We are in the Lemon Grove area, not quite next door to Mount Miguel High School, where my older sister, myself, and my younger brother graduated from.</p>

            <h1>What hobbies and / or interests do you have?</h1>
            <p>Umm, I've got quite a bit. How about I put them in list form?</p>

                    <dt>Comics and Pop Culture</dt>
                    <dd>As mentioned earlier, I attend the San Diego Comic Con. This year was its 50th anniversary, and it was the 25th year in a row for me attending in the Alvin costume!</dd>
                    <dt>Role Playing Games</dt>
                    <dd>I've been playing different dice and pencil RGPs for many years. Here's an unordered list of such tabletop RPG's I've played:
                        <ul>
                            <li>1st edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons</li>
                            <li>Top Secret! (by TSR)</li>
                            <li>Marvel Super Heroes (by TSR)</li>
                            <li>Car Wars (Steve Jackson Games)</li>
                            <li>Star Frontiers (by TSR)</li>
                            <li>Palladium, including Rifts and Robotech</li>
                            <li>Pathfinder</li>
                            <li>Both 3rd and v3.5 editions of Dungeons & Dragons</li>
                            <li>GURPS 3rd edition (by Steve Jackson Games)</li>
                            <li>Champions</li>
                            <li>5th edition Dungeons & Dragons</li>
                        </ul>
                        Even though I've played many systems, it's almost always been with generally the same group of friends that started back in high school. Our interests have also expanded to a related hobby...
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Renaissance Faire</dt>
                    <dd>My gaming group decided a long time ago to first try live action role playing, but then found that they liked doing Ren Faires with stage safe metal weapons and teaching and demonstrating Medieval and Renaissance history. So, they
                        created a fictional Swiss mercenary group called Rosenkeep. We have been participating for several San Diego based Faires, with the latest being the Escondido semiannual Faire, now for the past ten years. With that interest, we
                        each had to deal with the expenses of props and costuming, which now leads to another hobby, which is...</dd>
                    <dt>Leather Working and Armoring</dt>
                    <dd>While figuring out what kinds of equipment would be needed to have a good Renaissance Faire camp and costume, that led to learning how to shape, cut, and dye leather items, including armor. And, while studying different armors including
                        leather, I got to learn different techniques that led to shaping metal as well, to make plate and chain mail items.</dd>

            <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
            <p>Honestly, I'm somewhat desperate to get good employment, and this program seems to be one of my best shots.</p>
