        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Hi there! My name really is Alvin and some know me as the "Alvin Guy" from Comic Con. If you did a Google image search for "Alvin Comic Con", you'd find <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=alvin+comic+con&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS854US854&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjG8JXd4pLkAhWFtp4KHXJZCwgQ_AUIEygD&biw=1280&bih=610">me</a>!

            <h1>Where am I from?</h1>
            <p>I was born in Manila, Philippines, but since Dad was in the US Navy, we grew up in whatever Navy town that Dad got stationed in. That's how we eventually wound up here in San Diego, where he retired.</p>

            <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
            <p>We are in the Lemon Grove area, not quite next door to Mount Miguel High School, where my older sister, myself, and my younger brother graduated from.</p>

            <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
