    <h2>Bio</h2>

    <p>
        Billy was born in May 9, 1949 in The Bronx, New York, and grew up in Long Island, New York. Both of these places influenced his music. Growing up, at the insistence of his mother, he took piano lessons.
    </p>
    <p>
        Billy dropped out of high school to pursue a musical career. He took part in two bands, known as "The Hassles" and "Attila". He later singed a record deal with Family Productions, which kicked off his solo career in 1971. His first solo release was "Cold
        Spring Harbor".
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1972, he gave a stellar live radio performance of the song "Captain Jack". It became so popular in Philadelphia, that it caught the attention of Columbia Records. This led Billy to sign a new record deal with Col and release his second album "Piano
        Man".
    </p>
    <p>
        He released two more albums, "Streetlife Serenade" and "Turnstiles", with Columbia, before his critical and commercial breakthrough album in 1977, "The Stranger". This album became Columbia's best-seller, with over 10 million copies and spawning several
        hit singles, including "Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)", "Just the Way You Are", "Vienna", "Only the Good Die Young", and "She's Always a Woman". This album also features the song "Scenes from an Italian Restaurant". It is Billyâ€™s favorite from his
        own songs and has become a staple of his live shows.
    </p>
    <p>
        His last two albums, before going on near permanent world tour, are "Storm Front" in 1988 and "River of Dreams" in 1993.
